- **Challenges:** Limited performance due to linear decision boundaries.  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy: **33.42%**  
  - Precision: **33% (average)**  
  - Recall: **33% (average)**  


### Random Forest  

- **Strengths:** Robust to feature interactions and captures non-linear relationships.  
- **Challenges:** Computationally heavier than Logistic Regression.  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy: **34.18%**  
  - Precision: **34% (average)**  
  - Recall: **34% (average)**  


### XGBoost  

- **Strengths:** Handles imbalanced datasets effectively and identifies complex relationships.  
- **Challenges:** Computationally intensive and requires careful tuning.  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy: **33.56%**  
  - Precision: **34% (average)**  
  - Recall: **34% (average)**
